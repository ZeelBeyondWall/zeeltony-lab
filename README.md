Breaking walls, not builds.  
If it compiles, I move forward.

## About

I’m a developer who enjoys building things that actually work in real conditions, not just on paper.

Right now, I’m freelancing with **ASTA Trading Firm** (Powered by Tradebulls), where I mostly work on:
- Trading terminals  
- Algo-based systems  
- Internal tools used by traders  

Most of my work stays private ... client trust comes first.

## What I Do

I spend most of my time:
- Turning ideas into usable systems  
- Improving reliability and performance  
- Fixing things that break under real load  

I prefer simple, clear solutions over engineered ones.

---

## How I Think

I believe progress matters more than perfection.  
If something works and can be improved step by step, that’s good enough to move forward.

---

## Notes

You won’t find many public repositories here.  
Not because I don’t build, but because most of what I build is meant to stay internal.
